# ftc5159-18

FTC team 5159 in season 2018-2019 includes eight 7th graders in Punahou School in Hawaii.  As a rookie team, we managed to be #3 in the state championship tournation.

Since it's the first time the team used java, the code could use lots of improvements.  I am sure that we will be embarassed when we look at this code again next year.

The mission of the program is for Rover Ruckus, https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/ftc/game-and-season-info
