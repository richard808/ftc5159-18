FTC team 5159 season 2018-2019

FTC team 5159 in season 2018-2019 is a eight 7th grader in Punahou School in Hawaii.  A rookie team, we managed to be #3 in the state championship tournation.

The code needs lots of improvements.  I am sure that we will be embarassed when we review this code next year.
